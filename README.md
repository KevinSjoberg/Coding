# Standout Coding Standards

In order to write readable, eloquent and coherent code we help each other by storing
standards, conventions and helpful code examples in this repository.

We also have a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/jfyr8a0Y/standout-coding-board) where we store
links to useful projects, and discuss new things.
